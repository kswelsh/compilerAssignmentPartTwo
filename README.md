## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase the 'second step' the compiler performs; a syntax check.
This project was developed as an assignment at North Central College and some of the code was given to us.
We were required to fix the code that was broken, as well as add new code for certain functions. All of my edits
are marked with comments of my name.
